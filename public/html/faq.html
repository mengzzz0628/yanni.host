    <h2> A Sample Instructor Homepage </h2>

    <p> The system comes with a tutorial template (to teach how to write equizzes), a few sample questions (illustrating specific features) that can be altered and saved by instructors, and a full set of questions accompanying the Welch <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info/">Corporate Finance</a> introductory textbook.  An instructor who just wants to use the basic questions never needs to learn how to write her own equizzes (even though this is not difficult).</p>


    <h2> A Sample Equiz Question </h2>

    <p>This particular question uses complex math to show off what the websystem can display:</p>

    <h2> Generic Student Self-Use Without an Instructor </h2>

    <p>The site also maintains a generic introductory corporate finance course, which posts the relevant quizzes.  This is suitable for all students using any kind of book.  There is no coursesecret on this course, so any students can sign up, enroll in this course, and take quizzes to their delight.  Every time, the numbers are different, which means that the quizzes are useful even after having taken them once.</p>
