<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> <b>Finance 430</b> teaches the foundations of corporate finance.  The covered segments are:

<dl>
<dt> Basics</dt> <dd>Rates of Return. Extended Review.</dd>
<dt> Valuation</dt> <dd>How should anyone (a manager) decide whether to take or buy a project?  How does financial valuation differ from accounting valuation?  Do taxes matter?</dd>
<dt> Investments</dt> <dd>An abbreviated version to cover what we need in corporate finance: How should an investor choose an investment portfolio?  Do taxes matter?  What kind of opportunities does the market like?</dd>
<dt> Corporate Finance</dt> <dd>How can a manager finance projects?  What is a good capital structure/issuing policy?  Why are markets so skeptical of management?  Do taxes matter?</dd>
</dl>

<p><i>Basics</i> and <i>Investments</i> overlap with material covered in <i>430</i>. You might be able to skip this course if you were a top student in Investments and if you have the discipline to read the book by yourself&mdash;your call.  However, if you plan on a career in business (finance or consulting) or academic finance, then thorough knowledge of this material is of great importance.  Make sure you know it without holes.



<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Good knowledge of these subjects is important for anyone considering a career in economics, academic economics or finance, consulting, investment banking, trading, and corporate management.  The subject matter may not be to the taste of every student, for it is by nature technical&mdash;though it is not highly mathematical.

<p><b>Finance 430</b> is as much about subject matter, as it is about teaching <i>the language of management</i>.  Knowledge of this material is the common ground upon which most managerial decisions center.  Both <b>Finance 408</b> (Investments) and <b>Finance 430</b> (Corporate Finance) are truly the prerequisites to all other finance and strategy classes.

<p>Although the subject is by nature quantitative, I place as much emphasis on common sense, on the ability to know how to approach problems, and on the way of thinking, as I place on formulas and equations.  If something appears not to make sense&mdash;here, in other classes, or in the real world&mdash;<i>ask</i>!  A friendly or even funny inquiry or challenge, in a productive spirit, is <i>always</i> welcome.  I am not (too) arrogant, and I can take it as well as I can give it.  Participate, please.  Make the class fun!  (And please don't take offense to innocent but inappropriate remarks.)


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li> A thorough and comfortable ability to handle algebra and arithmetic.  There is <i>no</i> higher math in this course, but there are a lot of formulas and equations.  Math aptitude helps; math knowledge does not.
<li> Basic Excel or advanced calculator knowledge.  Email and web use.
<li> The ability to pick up an accounting and a statistics introdutory textbook, and read up what is necessary.
</ul>

<h2>Workload Warning</h2>

<p>I am a believer in <i>learning by doing</i>, so do not assume this class is easy or works on cruise-control.  The suggested out-of-course workload is targeted for an <i>average</i> of 4 hours per week, sometimes more, sometimes less.


<h2>Background Knowledge</h2>

<p>This class will necessarily be easy for some students and difficult for other students.  If you find that the class progress is perfect for you in terms of speed, you will be in the minority.  If you find the material very difficult, you must take the initiative to keep up with the material.  The TAs and I are providing many sources of help, but you will likely fail if you wait until the week before the midterm.  If you find the material very easy, please <i>throttle</i> your participation during class sessions.  Please do not show off that you find the material too easy. I want to engage everyone&mdash;and especially students that struggle with the material!


<h2>Class Attendance</h2>

<p>If you have managed others, you already know that attitude is everything.  Bring a mature, professional attitude to class.  Attendance on-time is proper business etiquette and a minimal requirement for classroom participation.  Even though everyone can be late once or twice for an emergency, being regularly late is unprofessional.  Because participation is a part of the grading system of this course, frequent late appearance is not to your advantage.

<p>If you are more than 10 minutes late, please do not bother to come.  Coming in late interrupts the class.  If you already know the material, you do not need to attend class, at all.  However, all students are expected to attend the presentations.


<h2>Name Cards</h2>

<p>Please always set up your name card <i>without</i> me having to remind you.  Having a name sign is useful not only to me, but also to other students who do not know you personally.


<h2>Computer Use</h2>

<p>You are <i>not</i> permitted to use a computer or other internet connected device during class. I do not use powerpoint. Print the classnotes and bring them to class (as well as a calculator).  Pencil your own notes on them.  If you want to make computer readable notes, transcribe your pencilled notes afterwards.  This improves both your learning and the overall classroom atmosphere&mdash;even though answering your emails will have to wait until after class.  Please abide by this policy without me having to remind you.</p>


<h2>Electronic Attendance</h2>

<p>Each student is required to check the class web site at least once every day.  Important news will be flagged at the top.  Students are responsible to have read posted announcements.  They may even contain new assignments, and it is not an excuse if you have not read it there.  Similarly, <i>my computer died</i> is not an excuse&mdash;backup is your friend.</p>


<h2>Office Hours and Escalation</h2>

<p>We have deliberately scheduled TAs for every day of the week.  Note that I (the instructor) have already tried to explain the answer to questions in my book, lectures, and classnotes.  Thus, I believe it is best if you first see if you can get another perspective.  This may well be a co-student.  It may be a TA to give you a different perspective.  (Being confused at first when learning is normal!  Your goal should be to unconfuse yourself by trying yourself and by asking questions.)  The TAs will also try to answer questions by email.  Of course, if none of this works, please come and see me.  I am here to help (though not usually by email).</p>

<p>Do not expect the TAs to know <i>everything</i>.  They are there to try to help you, but they are not me&mdash;and, besides, even I do not know everything about finance, either!</p>



<h2>Necessary Class Preparation</h2>

<ul>
<li> Read the relevant book chapter <i>before</i> class.  You will not understand everything, but you should understand a good part of it. Having preread the material should help you to follow the discussion in class&mdash;and enjoy the cold-calling more.
<li> Print and look over the classnotes ahead of time.
<li> Attend class.  Bring an ordinary calculator to class.  Bring the classnotes for the previous, the current, and the next session.
<li> Read the relevant classnotes and book chapter again <i>after</i> class, and in more detail.
<li> Do the assignments and homeworks.
</ul>

If you stick religiously to these instructions, you will most likely do very well in the course&mdash;with an A or at least a B.


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Do not view yourself as my customer.  Do not confuse me for an employee, for customer service, or for tech support.  I am a professor of finance.</p>

<p>It is entirely your responsibility to learn.  I can only aid you in <i>your</i> endeavor to learn. I do view it as my responsibility to help you learn, to the best of my own ability.  This is <i>why</i> I want to be a finance professor in the first place&mdash;to help students who really do want to learn to actually learn.  I could care less about the others.  It is your obligation to catch up with material you miss, for whatever reasons.  I cannot repeat my lectures in private.</p>

<p>In the end, it is up to you what you make of this course.  You should try your best to stay on top of the current material, and take advantage of all resources offered to you.  If you find yourself seriously behind, consider hiring a tutor&mdash;the earlier the better.  Beginning one week before the exam may be too late.  If you cannot afford hiring a tutor, talk to me and let me know.  I have contributed to funding tutors for needy students in the past.</p>


<h2>Permitted Exam Paraphernelia</h2>

<p>We will vote whether you prefer closed-book and closed-note exams (which will be easier), or open-book and open-note exams.  In any case, Time pressure will make it difficult for you to look up too many answers.  You may bring one single <b>3'' by 5''</b> index card on which you may write anything you wish, front and back.  You may bring a calculator, but not a computer.</p>


<h2>Honor Code</h2>

<p>We have an honor code, which prohibits cheating and plagiarism.  Please report any violations to me.</p>

<p>You must agree not to cheat on the exams; and to inform me if you see other students cheating.  Seating space may be at a premium, and it is tempting to glance at your neighbor's solutions.  Do not do it: the penalties far outweigh the benefit.  I will try to press for the maximum possible penalty&mdash;and I have a reputation to defend: I have caught cheaters in the past.</p>



<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>If you have problems with me or the TAs, our strong preference is that you please come to see us first&mdash;either the person who you have problems with, or one of the other two members of our teaching team.  (You can ask to keep your identity confidential, and we will honor this.)  We want to make this class a great experience for everyone involved, and we are open to learning from you how to do it better.  (In particular, I know that I occasionally go over the top with my brand of cynical and politically incorrect sense of humor, even though I wish I did not.  If you are extremely sensitive to inappropriate humor [or perhaps my lack of humor, depending on your point of view], you may be better off taking the class from another instructor.)</p>


<h2>Readings</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Class Notes</dt> <dd> The class notes are available on the class website.  Although the class notes are posted, they may be changed as time goes by.  Please print slides no earlier than 1 week before they are used in class. (Otherwise, you may have to look at a slightly different set of notes from what will be used in class).  Note that, unlike for a book or article, there is no copyright charge, so multiple prints are still fairly cheap.)  The classnotes are the definitive source of required knowledge.  They are not spaced by class, but spaced by topic.  We should be able to cover roughly 10--25 pages of notes per class.</dd>
  
<dt>Textbook</dt> <dd>The book for this course is <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info/ed3/">Ivo Welch, <i>Corporate Finance: An Introduction</i>, 3rd ed</a>.  Although the book is free online, I would suggest you purchase a printed copy, both for marking up and for uptime guarantee.  (My website may well go down for a week before the exam; I am not a pro sysadmin.)  The book is deliberately priced at cost, which is about 1/4 the price of its peers.

<dt> Other Readings and Skills</dt>
<dd>

<ul>

<li> You may also find it useful to have access to a book on valuation, such as Copeland, Koller, Murrin's <i>Valuation</i> (McKinsey Press), or Bradford Cornell's <i>Corporate Valuation</i> (Irwin).
  
<li> I can also recommend some other corporate finance textbooks: Berk-DeMarzo <i>Corporate Finance</i>, Brealey-Myers'
  <i>Fundamental of Corporate Finance</i>; Ross-Westerfield-Jaffe <i>Corporate Finance</i>; and the higher-level Grinblatt and Titman <i>Financial Markets and Corporate Strategy</i>.  The GT text is more complementary to my own textbook than the first three.
    
<li> Professional Readings: Everyone in the class should subscribe to or at least read regularly <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>.  You absolutely cannot walk into an interviewing situation without knowledge of (and/or an opinion about) current events.  Similarly, you should not walk into a financial services or consulting interviewing situation if you are not tech-savvy.  For example, what are the best financial websites and why?

<li> Professional speaking and writing is very important. Take an acting course.  It helps you to learn how to present yourself.  This is especially useful for foreign students.

<li> The ability to manipulate data quickly is very important.  Take a computer programming course.  The world is becoming more analytical and data-oriented.  Are you sure you are equipped to handle it?

</ul>

</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Class Project: Pro-Forma Project</h2>

<p>At the midterm, I will take a vote about whether we should add a class project.  This class project would be an analyst pro-forma valuation for a business.  In the past, I have invited partners from Vicente Capital Partners and Ares Management (Private Equity), who discussed projects that they had recently taken on.  The plus is that these are not only great applications of the material in the class, but outright fascinating.  The minus is that they require about 20-40 hours of time per student over about 3 weeks.  It also means that we have one session fewer and thus need to cover the in-class material faster, and that we have to be flexible to accommodate the speaker's schedule.  The pro-formas need to be good: they are not graded by me, but by the speaker.  We need to leave a good impression representing Anderson.

<p>If we do it, then <i>the team project</i> counts for about 15% of the grade. Nevertheless, grade dispersion has traditionally not been high enough to matter greatly in the final letter grades for the class&mdash;pro formas have too many subjective aspects.
  
<p>    For the team project, each team must consist of 3--5 students.  (Not 2 and not 6!  You will not get any bonus if you are only 2 students&mdash;and trust me, building a pro forma with 2 students is a much harder task than it is with 4 students.) Choose your group carefully to avoid free-riders.  Also, please note that it is not an excuse if your team members drop out, or if one ends up having an illness.  The project is assigned 6 weeks in advance&mdash;in the real world, there is no such thing as a <i>permitted delay for someone being non-disposed</i>.

<p>    Each team writeup should be 4--6 pages of text, and no more than 15 pages (incl.  figures and tables) in total.  Class reports should also be submitted in .pdf format and <i>will be posted on the class website</i>.  The team project is also graded on readability and comprehensibility: if your answer is not immediately obvious, it is your problem.  You must follow proper citation rules to avoid plagiarism.

<p>    To keep competition fair, we can only answer a few clarifying questions, and primarily through the website&mdash;and especially not during the last week of the assignment, when other groups will be almost done.


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Grading is <i>relative</i> to other students.  The class will obey the quasi-mandatory Anderson grade curve&mdash;about 40% A's, 40% B's, 15% C's, and 5% F's.  (As far as your transcript is concerned, you should neither be punished nor rewarded for taking this course.  I am not here to fight or condone grade inflation or deflation.)  We will give it our best efforts to be appropriate and fair, but perfection in grading is intrinsically impossible.  Homeworks and exams are the same across all sections.

<dl>

<dt>Midterm (30%):</dt>

<dd>The midterm questions are basically the same format and level of difficulty as the homeworks.  If you have no problems answering similar questions <i>under time pressure</i>, you will also have no problem in the midterms.  If you are not present for the midterm, we will use your final as the sole grade determinant.  This also means that you are just losing the option of improving your score, though.

<dt> Final (40%):</dt> 

<dd>The final is similar to the midterm in format, but cumulative in coverage.  If you cannot make the scheduled final on (with prior justification sent to the TA team), then you can attend the makeup final.  If you miss both final exam dates, then you have the choice between taking an oral exam with me that I will administer (my advice: avoid this!) and taking the final exam next year from another instructor teaching the same course.

<dt> <th>Homeworks, Project, Discretion (30%):</dt> 

<dd>

<ol>
<li>    <i>Homeworks</i> count for about 0-5% of the grade.  Essentially, I will take the number of submitted homeworks into account for students that are close to the margin between grades, but ignore them otherwise.

<p>    The homeworks are the questions at the end of each chapter of the book.  They are due seven days after completing a chapter.  Of course, you can work ahead on homeworks if you so wish.

<p>    We only record the chapters for which you have handed in a reasonable attempt to answer the homework questions.  Our intent is that you gain <i>nothing</i> from copying answers from previous years (or your colleagues).  On the contrary, doing so will only guarantee that your exam performance will be worse.  Don't cheat yourself.

<p>    You should do your homework individually, although group discussion prior to the writeup is just fine.  The goal is for you to learn from the homeworks, not to get a high score on them.  When handing in homeworks, please keep a copy for yourself.  Brevity rules.
  
<p>    The most important aspect of the homeworks is that they prepare you for the course exams.  For 9 out of 10 students, the homeworks will be irrelevant to the final course grade.

<p>    There will be more homework early in the course.  In particular, capital structure theory is more conceptual and thus has fewer homeworks.  Instead, you are expected to spend the time producing a pro forma with your team in the last third of the course.

  
<li>  <i>My discretion</i> counts for about 17% of the grade.  This part is purely at my discretion.  For most students, it equates to classroom participation and attitude.  <i>Many regrading requests can also lower this score.  This is necessary for fairness given that we do look at relative performance.</i>

<p>  Please note that I much prefer to have lively and funny students (yes, I can take humor as well [or as poorly] as I dish it out) than wet sacks in the audience.  Be alive!  It may help your grade.

<p>  You should realize that traditionally, there is fairly little dispersion in performance across students in this last component of the grade.  Thus, even though this final component formally counts as much as half the midterm and final, in the end, it is the midterm and final that tend to explain more like 95% of the grade.

</ol>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some more internal process detail: In assigning course grades, I often put more weight on the better of the midterm and the final. After the midterm+final computation, I would add in the project score, the homework score, and my discretionary score.  Typically, these three scores together make a difference in changing the grades only for the approximately 5% of students that are on the margin.  Put differently, for the overwhelming majority of students, it is the midterm and final that determine the grade.
 If you are more than one standard deviation above the mean on the midterm, and you are taking this course pass-fail, then I will pass you even if you do not take the final exam.</p>





<h2>Regrading Policy</h2>

<p>The TAs will make mistakes on all exams, some in the student's favor, some against.  Because grading is relative to other students, we do not want to systematically reward nitpicking.  However, we also do not wish to make a systematic mistake in particularly hard cases.  So, our regrading policy is as follows.

<p> A student requesting a regrade can choose between one of two options:</p>

<ol>

<li> A regrade only of specific questions in dispute.  However, this "costs" an immediate penalty of one question.  Thus, a student with two incorrectly graded questions in favor and two against should choose this option.</li>

<li> A regrade of the entire exam, with a clear directive for the TAs to reexamine every answer.  Thus, a student with one incorrectly graded question in favor and none against should choose this option.  <i>It is possible for the overall exam score to decline when this option is chosen.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In addition, be aware that I am using my grading discretion partially to penalize multiple regrading requests.  (We do not when it is as simple as our missing questions altogether.)  This may be unfair to some individuals <i>ex-post</i>, but discouraging regrading <i>ex-ante</i> improves fairness for everyone (because grading is on a curve)!  We do not want to penalize students who do not want to ask for constant regrades.

<p>We do make random copies of exams.  We have caught at least one student in the past who thought it was a good idea to clarify his answers in the exam itself after the fact.  His answers were indeed greatly improved.  His grade was not.  He was duly expelled.



<h2>More Incentives</h2>

<p>I will invite the best students that received a distinction in my course to become my TAs the following year.  This will be a great teaching experience for those selected, aside from the fact that employers are usually impressed by this.

<p>When it comes to I-banks recruiting, I tend to inform a few selected interviewers (usually 3-5 firms) who the top students in my class are.  (I do not recommend against particular students, nor do I tell all interviewers about all students.  I try to give information only to help some students get better interviews, not in order to exclude or handicap students.) If you do not want positive information about you to be divulged, please let me know ahead of time.



<h2>Rough Course Outline</h2>

<p>This course has to strike a balance between students extraordinarily well prepared for this class and students extraordinarily poorly prepared for this class.  To strike the appropriate balance, the timing in the syllabus below is only indicative: It is more important that 90% of the students learn the material in the syllabus well, than it is to rigidly stick to an exact schedule.  There is a lot of material to cover&mdash;and it's not my choice, but your interviewers'.  (We could hold the midterm on Friday Feb 12 if students prefer.)  You can count on a class to continue onto the next topic early, if a subject is completed early.  So, always bring the next session's slides.
